# mechanisms_ml
The goal for these models is to help automate the mechanism of injury labeling process on NEISS data. This process is currently very manual, so the labels used from this https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33934725/ which goes from 2010-2019, will be used to train a model to predict injury mechanisms past 2019
